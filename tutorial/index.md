title: Introduction
---

This tutorial is where to start learning the basics of [Meteor](https://meteor.com) with [React](https://react.dev/).
In this tutorial, we will build a To-Do app that will insert and fetch data from MongoDB, authenticate users with passwords, and also GitHub.

We will create, update, and remove tasks using Methods, and present them with real-time updates using Publications and Subscriptions.
Later in the tutorial, we will run this app on mobile, create automated tests, and even deploy it to a real server using [Meteor Cloud](https://www.meteor.com/cloud).

## Before you Start

### Checking The Code

If you want to check the final code of each step, you can always go to the [`src`](https://github.com/meteor/react-tutorial/tree/master/src) folder.

### Installation and Running the App

Each folder inside the [`src`](https://github.com/meteor/react-tutorial/tree/master/src) folder represents a tutorial. Inside each, you have one folder for each step's final state.
Each step folder is a Meteor app - you can run them at any time.
  - Install it: `meteor npm install`
  - Run it: `meteor`

### Understanding Code Samples

If you see `..` in the code samples, it means that we are not showing all the code in this file or function.

## Community Support

If you have questions about how to get started, please ask the community on our [Forums](https://forums.meteor.com) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hZkTCaVjmT). We'd love to have you there!

## Where to Learn More

Meteor works out-of-the-box with several other frameworks like [Blaze](https://blaze-tutorial.meteor.com/), [Svelte](https://svelte-tutorial.meteor.com/), [Vue 3](https://vue3-tutorial.meteor.com/) and [Vue 2](https://vue-tutorial.meteor.com/).
